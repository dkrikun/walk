.SH "NAME"
\fBwalk\fR \- A fast, lightweight, general purpose, graph based build and task execution utility\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBwalk\fR \fB\-\-version\fR

\fBwalk\fR [\fB\-d\fR] [target]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
walk(1) is a small utility that can be used to execute tasks, or build programs from source\. It\'s similar to make(1) in many ways, but with some fundamental differences that make it vastly simpler, and arguably more powerful\.
.
.P
At the core of walk(1) is a Directed Acyclic Graph \fIhttps://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph\fR (DAG)\. DAG\'s are a magical data structure that allow you to easily express dependency trees\. You\'ll find DAG\'s everywhere; in git \fIhttp://eagain\.net/articles/git\-for\-computer\-scientists/\fR, languages, infrastructure tools \fIhttps://github\.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/dag\fR, etc\. walk(1) provides a general UNIX utility to express a DAG as a set of targets (files) that depend on each other\.
.
.P
walk(1) can be used to build just about anything, from C/C++ programs to frontend applications (css, sass, coffeescript, etc) and infrastructure (CloudFormation, Terraform)\. Basically, anything that can express it\'s dependencies can be built\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Show stdout from rules when executing the \fBexec\fR phase\.
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Print the dependencies of the target(s)\. This can be used in conjunction with a file watching utility like fswatch(1) to execute a target whenever its dependencies have changed\.
.
.SH "TARGETS"
Targets can be used to represent a task, or a file that needs to be built\. They are synonymous with targets in make(1)\. In general, targets are relative paths to files that need to be built, like \fBsrc/hello\.o\fR\. When a target does not relate to an actual file on task, it\'s synonymous with \fB\.PHONY\fR targets in make(1)\.
.
.P
walk(1) will look for a "rule" file to determine if it has dependencies, or needs to be built\. Rules are described below\.
.
.SH "RULES"
Rules determine \fIhow\fR a target is built, and are defined as executable files\.
.
.P
When walk(1) begins execution of a target, it first attempts to find a compatible rule for the target by looking at executable files ending in \fB\.walk\fR or any files inside a \fB\.walk\fR directory\. As an example, say we wanted to build \fBhello\.o\fR by executing \fBwalk hello\.o\fR\. walk(1) will attempt, in order, the following files:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

\&\.walk/hello\.o
hello\.o\.walk
\.walk/default\.o
default\.o\.walk
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
As an example, a simple rule file for building \fB\.o\fR files from \fB\.c\fR files, could be named \fBdefault\.o\.walk\fR and might look like this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#!/bin/bash

target=$2
src=${2//\.o/\.c}

deps() {
  echo $src
}

compile() {
  gcc \-Wall \-o $target \-c $src
}

case $1 in
  deps) deps ;;
  exec) compile ;;
esac
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
When walk executes a rule, it executes it with the following positional arguments:
.
.TP
\fB$1\fR
The \fIphase\fR (\fBdeps\fR or \fBexec\fR)\.
.
.TP
\fB$2\fR
The name of the target to build (e\.g\. \fBhello\.o\fR)\.
.
.P
walk(1) will only look for these files in the same directory that the target is in\. If no suitable rule is found, and the file already exists, then walk(1) assumes that it\'s a static file and does nothing\.
.
.SH "PHASES"
walk(1) has two phases:
.
.TP
\fBPlan\fR
In this phase, walk(1) executes all the rules with \fBdeps\fR as the first argument\. Rules are expected to print a newline delimited list of files that the target depends on, relative to the target\. Internally, walk(1) builds a graph of all of the targets and their dependencies\.
.
.TP
\fBExec\fR
In this phase, walk(1) executes all of the rules files with \fBexec\fR as the first argument\. Rules are expected to build the given target, but don\'t need to if it\'s, for example, a task (like \fBtest\fR, \fBclean\fR, etc)\.
.
.P
By separating these phases, walk(1) can build a compact dependency graph, and perform fast parallel builds\.
.
.SH "COMPARISONS"
walk(1) is heavily inspired by make(1) and redo \fIhttps://github\.com/apenwarr/redo\fR\. There are a number of reasons why walk(1) may be better in certain scenarios:
.
.TP
\fBSimplicity\fR
walk(1) does not have anything synonymous with make(1)\'s Makefile \fIhttps://www\.gnu\.org/software/make/manual/make\.html\fR\. Everything is simply defined as executable files, which provides the ultimate level of flexibility on UNIX to compose existing tools\.
.
.TP
\fBConditional Execution\fR
For mostly legacy reasons, make(1) determines whether a target needs to be built based on the file modification time of its dependencies\. While this works well for building C/C++ programs on a local machine, it breaks down in scenarios where you have a large complex build system that runs in a shared environment\. Also, depending on the target, other caching mechanisms like content hashing may be more suitable\. There are attempts \fIhttp://blog\.jgc\.org/2006/04/rebuilding\-when\-hash\-has\-changed\-not\.html\fR to get around this handicap, but none that work well\. walk(1) leaves conditional execution up to the Rule\.
.
.TP
\fBRecursiveness\fR
Recursive make is generally a mistake\. Because of walk(1)\'s design, you can execute \fBwalk\fR from any directory, and always get the same result\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
For the following examples, we\'ll assume that we want to build a program called hello \fIhttps://github\.com/ejholmes/walk/tree/master/test/111\-compile\fR from \fBhello\.c\fR and \fBhello\.h\fR\. This can be expressed as a DAG, like the following:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

                              all
                               |
                             hello
                               |
                            hello\.o
                            /     \e
                        hello\.c hello\.h
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
When \fBwalk\fR is invoked without any arguments, it defaults to a target called \fBall\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

walk
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
You can provide one or more targets as arguments to specify where to start execution from\. For example, if wanted to build just \fBhello\.o\fR and any of it\'s dependencies:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

walk hello\.o
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
When rules are executed, they\'re always executed relative to the basename of the target\. This means that we can execute \fBwalk\fR from any directory, and always get the same behavior\. All of the following are identical:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

walk hello\.o
cd \.\. && walk 111\-compile/hello\.o
cd \.\. && walk test/111\-compile/hello\.o
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
